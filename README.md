## Problem Statement

The eCommerce platform, as analyzed through the Power BI report, shows strong sales performance in select regions and categories, particularly Technology and the APAC and US markets. However, the high shipping cost relative to profit, and the uneven distribution of sales across different markets and countries, indicate potential inefficiencies and missed opportunities. The business needs to identify the causes behind low-performing markets and optimize shipping logistics to improve overall profitability and regional balance in sales performance.
